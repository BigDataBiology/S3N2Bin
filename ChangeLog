	* More flexible specification of prebuilt models (case insensitive,
	normalize - and _)

Version 1.0.3 Wed Aug 3 2022 by BigDataBiology
	* Fix coverage parsing when value is not an integer (#103)
	* Fix multi_easy_bin with taxonomy file given on the command line

Version 1.0.2 Fri 8 Jul 2022 by BigDataBiology
	* Fix issue #93 more thoroughly (see #101)

Version 1.0.1 Mon 9 May 2022 by BigDataBiology
	* Fix edge case when calling prodigal with more threads than contigs (#93)

	* More balanced file split when calling prodigal in parallel
	* Fix bug when long stretches of Ns are present (#87)
	* Better error messages (#90 & #91)

Version 0.7.0 Wed 3 Mar 2022 by BigDataBiology
	* Improve `check_install` command by printing out paths and correctly
	handling optionality of FragGeneScan/prodigal
	* Reuse markers.hmmout to make the training from several samples faster
	* Add option `--tmpdir` to set temporary directory
	* Substitute FragGeneScan with Prodigal (FragGeneScan can still be used
	with `--orf-finder` parameter)
	* Add 'concatenate_fasta' command to combine fasta files for multi-sample binning

Version 0.6.0 Mon 7 Feb 2022 by BigDataBiology
	* Provide pretrained models from soil, cat gut, human oral,
	pig gut, mouse gut, built environment, wastewater and global (training
	from all environments).
	* Add `check_install` command and run `check_install` before easy* command
	* The user can now specify a pre-computed contig annotation table in
	mmseqs format
	* Fix bug with non-standard characters in sample names (#68)
	* Better subcommand names (`generate_sequence_features_*` and
	`generate_cannot_links`)

Version 0.5.0 Fri Jan 7 2022 by BigDataBiology
	* Faster `SemiBin --version`
	* Lower memory usage and faster speed for `bin` subcommand
	* Reclustering is now the default (due to improved speed). Added
	`--no-recluster` option to disable it
	* Output of bedtools is now processed as a stream instead of using a
	(potentially large) intermediate file
	* Fix bug with --min-len. Previously, only contigs greater than the given
	minimal length were used (instead of greater-equal to the minimal length).
	* Fix bugs downloading GTDB
	* Respect $XDG_CACHE_DIR if set
	* Implement CACHEDIR.TAG protocol for the SemiBin cache directory

Version 0.4.0 Tue Oct 10 2021 by BigDataBiology
	* Add support for .xz FASTA files as inputs
	* Removed BioPython dependency
	* Fixed bug in FASTA unzipping
	* Fixed bug in multi-sample data splitting

Version 0.3.0 Mon Aug  9 2021 by BigDataBiology
	* Support training from several samples
	* Remove `output_bin_path` if `output_bin_path` exists
	* Make several internal parameters configuable (1) minimum length of
	contigs to bin (`--min-len` parameter); (2) minimum length of contigs to
	break up in order to generate _must-link_ constraints (`--ml-threshold`
	parameter); (3) the ratio of the number of base pairs of contigs between
	1000-2500 bp smaller than this value, the minimal length will be set as
	1000bp, otherwise 2500bp
	* Add `-p` argument for `predict_taxonomy` mode
	* Fix `np.concatenate` warning
	* Remove redundant matrix when clustering
	* Better pretrained models
	* Faster calculating dapth using Numpy
	* Use correct number of threads in `kneighbors_graph()`
	* Respect number of threads (`-p` argument) when training (issue 34)



Version 0.2.0 Thu May 27 2021 by BigDataBiology
	* Change name to `SemiBin`
	* Add support for training with several samples
	* Test with Python 3.9
	* Download mmseqs database with `--remove-tmp-file 1`
	* Better output names
	* Fix bugs when paths have spaces
	* Fix installation issues by listing all the dependencies
	* Add `download_GTDB` command
	* Add `--no-recluster` option
	* Add `--environment` option
	* Add `--mode` option

Version 0.4.0 Tue Oct 10 2021 by BigDataBiology
	* Add support for .xz FASTA files as inputs
	* Removed BioPython dependency
	* Fixed bug in FASTA unzipping
	* Fixed bug in multi-sample data splitting

Version 0.3.0 Mon Aug  9 2021 by BigDataBiology
	* Support training from several samples
	* Remove `output_bin_path` if `output_bin_path` exists
	* Make several internal parameters configuable (1) minimum length of
	contigs to bin (`--min-len` parameter); (2) minimum length of contigs to
	break up in order to generate _must-link_ constraints (`--ml-threshold`
	parameter); (3) the ratio of the number of base pairs of contigs between
	1000-2500 bp smaller than this value, the minimal length will be set as
	1000bp, otherwise 2500bp
	* Add `-p` argument for `predict_taxonomy` mode
	* Fix `np.concatenate` warning
	* Remove redundant matrix when clustering
	* Better pretrained models
	* Faster calculating dapth using Numpy
